COVID-19-QR-Generator-for-Attendance-System

The Quick Response (QR) code-based attendance system is composed of two different applications; (1) a QR code generator mobile application and (2) a QR attendance desktop application for attendance monitoring and recording of health declaration forms of every student. The goal of this system is to avoid direct contact while also saving records digitally and effectively.

In the QR code generator for mobile phones, the students are asked for their basic information such as their full name, course and section, student number, and contact number. In every QR code generation, the user will fill up a health declaration form consisting of COVID-19 related questions and body temperature. If the conditions set by the program are met, a QR code will be generated for later use.
